## Hello people!ðŸ‘‹ I am **MO** ( Marcia if you want to be more formal )

I am a Data Analyst with a background in environmental sciences ðŸŒ±.

### About Me

I specialize in deciphering and translating the messages behind the universal language of Data. Whether you are looking forward to improving your performance or finding the right direction for your strategy, my motivation is finding answers to your questions ðŸ”­. My experience in research has prepared me to solve complex and multidisciplinary problems and to develop my skills in data analysis, visualization, and prediction with machine learning models.

### Skills

### Outside of Work
When I'm not working on data-related projects, I like to nourish my Latin roots by preparing dinner for groups of friends but mostly by baking some sweet comforting dessert.
